# Description

In this project, I implemented a Twitext clone using JavaScript. Users can sign up and post their thoughts as tweets. You can find and follow other users to stay updated on their tweets. You can also like and comment on each other's tweets. The data is stored using localStorage, and the pages are built as a simple SPA (Single Page Application). Tweet, Follow, Engage. Your Twitext Experience Awaits...
